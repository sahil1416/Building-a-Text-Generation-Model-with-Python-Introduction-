# Building-a-Text-Generation-Model-with-Python-Introduction-


The goal of this assignment is to use Python to design and implement a generative model for text data. The model should be capable of generating new, creative, and grammatically correct sentences given an input prompt.

Task: Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset suitable for training a generative text model. A good starting point could be a public dataset like the Project Gutenberg Dataset. You might also consider scraping data from a legal source with a Python library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. 

You should then preprocess this data into a form suitable for your model, using Python libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
Model Design and Training: Design and implement a generative model for text data in Python. You might use a deep learning library such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.


Your model might be a Recurrent Neural Network, a Transformer model, or a GPT-based model. This tutorial on building a text generation model could be a good reference point. Your model should be able to generate creative and grammatically correct sentences given an input prompt.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate your model's performance using Python.

This might include quantitative measures, such as perplexity, as well as qualitative measures, like the creativity and grammaticality of generated sentences.
